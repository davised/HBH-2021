Hypoxic barrier hypothesis manuscript data analysis - Figure 1 and Figure S1

Examine [the Rmd](./HBH.Rmd) or [the knitted html](./HBH.html) for the
analysis.

The git repo history shows additional analysis that was done on an early subset
of the data, including examining KO, KEGG, and EC numbers. As that preliminary
analysis did not uncover interesting correlations, we did not continue that
analysis for the full dataset.
