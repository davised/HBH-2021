# HBH-2021
Hypoxic barrier hypothesis manuscript data analysis

Check out [the Rmd](./HBH.Rmd) or [the knitted html](./HBH.html) for the
analysis.

The analysis included in this repo is far more than what was prepared for the
manuscript. We have EC number and KO ID analysis that yielded little additional
input to our hypothesis. Therefore, we scaled back the analysis to just the
terminal oxidases vs other oxidases.
